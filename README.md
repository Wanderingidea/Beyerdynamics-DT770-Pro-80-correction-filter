Passive headphone correction filter for Beyerdynamics DT770 Pro 80 headphones
The Beyerdynamics DT770 Pro 80 headphones sound very good. However, the lower frequencies are emphasized which sometimes results in 'rattling'.

Solderdude from 'DIY Audio Heaven' was so kind to send me the details of a passive filter to suppress the lower frequencies. This has to be placed between the headphone amplifier output and the headphones. See [DIY Audio Heaven](https://diyaudioheaven.wordpress.com/headphones/passive-filters/).

I built the filter in a piece of PVC electrical conduit pipe. The photos largely speak for themselves I think:

How does it sound? Definitely more neutral, lineair. Bass is not exaggerated anymore as was the intention and voices are more pronounced than without. I will keep the filter inserted, I like it.
